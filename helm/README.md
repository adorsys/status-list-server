# Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Status List Server using the provided Helm chart.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., AWS EKS)
- Helm 3 installed
- `kubectl` configured to connect to your cluster

## Chart Dependencies

This chart has the following dependencies:

- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database for storing application data.
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Official subchart (`open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector`) for collecting and routing traces, metrics, and logs.

These dependencies are managed by the Helm chart. PostgreSQL is enabled by default.

## Configuration

The following files are used to configure the deployment:

- [`chart/values.yaml`](chart/values.yaml): Default configuration for production environments.
- [`chart/values-local.yaml`](chart/values-local.yaml): Configuration for local development.

### Key Configuration Options

- **`statuslist.image.repository`**: The Docker image for the application.
- **`statuslist.image.tag`**: The Docker image tag.
- **`postgres.persistence.enabled`**: Enable or disable persistent storage for PostgreSQL.

## Credential Exposure Model

The chart intentionally avoids rendering fully assembled SQL database URLs in the Deployment. The application assembles the connection string inside the process from split configuration fields:

- Database: `APP_DATABASE__HOST`, `APP_DATABASE__PORT`, `APP_DATABASE__USERNAME`, `APP_DATABASE__PASSWORD`, `APP_DATABASE__NAME`

Password fields are rendered with `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`, so `kubectl describe pod` shows the referenced Secret name/key rather than a connection string containing credentials. Operators should still restrict RBAC for pod inspection, Secret reads, exec access, ephemeral containers, and workload log access to trusted roles only, because environment variables are visible inside the running container and Secret references identify where credentials live.

`APP_DATABASE__URL` remains supported by the application for local or custom deployments, but using it directly in Kubernetes pod specs accepts the tradeoff that users with pod-inspection permissions may see assembled connection strings. Prefer the split fields for Helm-managed deployments.

## Production Deployment Instructions

For GitHub Actions deployments to production, see the [Deployment Runbook](../docs/deployment-runbook.md). CI/CD owns production image tag injection with `statuslist.image.repository` and `statuslist.image.tag`; operators should avoid patching live images imperatively because Helm will reconcile the chart state on the next deploy. Failed upgrades roll back automatically through Helm `--atomic`; rollbacks after a successful but bad deploy are manual Helm operations.

1. **Create a namespace:**

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace statuslist
   ```

2. **Deploy the chart:**

   ```bash
   helm install statuslist ./chart --namespace statuslist -f chart/values.yaml
   ```

## Local Deployment

For local testing and development, please refer to the [Local Deployment Guide](../docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Verifying the Deployment

1. **Check the status of the pods:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n statuslist
   ```

2. **Check the application logs:**

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=status-list-server -n statuslist
   ```
