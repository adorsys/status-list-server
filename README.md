# Status List Server

The Status List Server is a web service that manages and publishes status lists, allowing issuers to update statuses and verifiers to retrieve them. It implements JWT-based authentication using ES256 (ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256) for securing its endpoints.

## Getting Started

Before running the server, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (Latest stable version recommended).
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/): The database system used for storing status lists.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download): The in-memory data structure store used for caching.

**Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adorsys/status-list-server.git
cd status-list-server
```

### Configuration

**Environment Variables:**

  Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Take a look at the [.env.template](.env.template) file for an example of the required variables.

### Running with Docker Compose

The simplest way to run the project is with [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

- Execute the command below at the root of the project

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

This command will pull all required images and start the server.

### Running Manually

To start the server, execute:

```bash
cargo run
```

By default, the server will listen on `http://localhost:8000`. You can modify the host and port in the configuration settings.

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

- **Endpoint:** `GET /health`
- **Description:** Checks the health status of the server.
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK`: Server is running.

### Register Issuer

- **Endpoint**: `POST /credentials/`
- **Description**: Allows issuers to register their public key and identifier for later authentication
- **Request Body**

  ```json
  {
    "issuer": "<issuer_id>",
    "public_key": "<public_key.pem>",
    "alg": "ES256"
  }
  ```

  - `issuer`: Unique identifier for the issuer
  - `public_key`: PEM-encoded public key
  - `alg`: "ES256" (ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256)

### Publish Status List

- **Endpoint**: `POST /statuslists/publish`
- **Description**: Allows an issuer to publish their token status list
- **Authorization**: Requires a valid signed JWT token with the corresponding registered private key with issuer's ID as the `kid` (Key ID) in the header
- **Request Body**

  ```json
  {
    "list_id": "30202cc6-1e3f-4479-a567-74e86ad73693",
    "status": [
      { "index": 1, "status": "INVALID" },
      { "index": 8, "status": "VALID" }
    ]
  }
  ```

  - `index`: Position in the status list
  - `status`: Status value (VALID, INVALID, SUSPENDED, APPLICATIONSPECIFIC)

### Update Status List

- **Endpoint:** `PUT /statuslists/update`
- **Description:** Allows an issuer to update an existing status list
- **Authorization:** Requires a valid signed JWT token with the corresponding registered private key with issuer's ID as the `kid` (Key ID) in the header
- **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "list_id": "755a0cf7-8289-4f65-9d24-0e01be92f4a6",
    "status": [
      {
        "index": 1,
        "status": "VALID"
      },
      {
        "index": 8,
        "status": "INVALID"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  - `list_id`: UUID of the status list to update
  - `status`: Array of status updates
    - `index`: Position in the status list
    - `status`: New status value (VALID, INVALID, SUSPENDED, APPLICATIONSPECIFIC)

  Example of a complete status update payload:

  ```json
  {
    "list_id": "755a0cf7-8289-4f65-9d24-0e01be92f4a6",
    "status": [
      {
        "index": 1,
        "status": "VALID"
      },
      {
        "index": 2,
        "status": "INVALID"
      },
      {
        "index": 3,
        "status": "SUSPENDED"
      },
      {
        "index": 4,
        "status": "APPLICATIONSPECIFIC"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Responses:**
  - `200 OK`: Update successful
  - `400 BAD REQUEST`: Invalid input data
  - `401 UNAUTHORIZED`: Invalid or missing JWT token
  - `403 FORBIDDEN`: Token issuer doesn't match list owner
  - `404 NOT FOUND`: Status list not found
  - `500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`: System incurred an error

### Retrieve Status List

- **Endpoint:** `GET /statuslists/{list_id}`
- **Description:** Retrieves the current status list for the requested list_id. This endpoint is publicly accessible with no authentication required.
- **Headers:**
  - `Accept`: Specifies the desired response format
    - `application/jwt`: Returns the status list as a JWT token
    - `application/cwt`: Returns the status list as a CWT token
    - Default: Returns the status list in a compressed and encoded format
- **Responses:**
  - `200 OK`: Returns the status list in the requested format
  - `404 NOT FOUND`: Status list not found
  - `406 NOT ACCEPTABLE`: Requested format not supported

### Status List Aggregation

- **Endpoint:** `GET /statuslists/aggregation`
- **Description:** Returns a JSON object containing an array of all status list URIs managed by the server. This allows Relying Parties to discover and cache all available status lists for offline or batch validation.
- **Response Example:**

  ```json
  {
    "status_lists": [
      "https://example.com/statuslists/1",
      "https://example.com/statuslists/2",
      "https://example.com/statuslists/3"
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Authentication:** Not required (public endpoint)

### Status List Token Format Update

- Every status list token (JWT or CWT) now includes an `aggregation_uri` claim, which provides the URI of the aggregation endpoint. Example JWT payload:

  ```json
  {
    "sub": "https://example.com/statuslists/1",
    "status_list": { "bits": 1, "lst": "..." },
    "exp": 2291720170,
    "ttl": 43200,
    "aggregation_uri": "https://example.com/statuslists/aggregation"
  }
  ```

## Authentication

The server uses JWT-based authentication with the following requirements:

1. Issuers must first register their public key using the `/credentials/` endpoint
2. All authenticated requests must include a JWT token in the Authorization header:

   ```http
   Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
   ```

3. The JWT token must:
   - Be signed with the algorithm specified during issuer registration.
   - Include the issuer's ID as the `kid` (Key ID) in the header
   - Be signed with the private key corresponding to the registered public key
   - Have valid `exp` (expiration) and `iat` (issued at) claims

Example JWT header:

```json
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "issuer-id"
}
```

## Certificate Provisioning and Renewal

The Status List Server is provisioned with a cryptographic certificate that is embedded into all issued status list tokens. This certificate ensures the authenticity and integrity of the tokens distributed by the server.

**Automatic Issuance and Renewal:**

- Certificate issuance and renewal are managed according to the configured renewal strategy.
- Every day at midnight, a cron job checks whether the certificate should be renewed based on this strategy.
- If the certificate is still considered valid according to the configured strategy, no renewal occurs; renewal is only triggered when necessary.

## Error Handling

The server implements proper error handling and returns appropriate HTTP status codes:

- `400 BAD REQUEST`: Invalid input data
- `401 UNAUTHORIZED`: Missing or invalid authentication token
- `403 FORBIDDEN`: Insufficient permissions
- `404 NOT FOUND`: Resource not found
- `500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`: Server-side error
